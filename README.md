# Simple Stock Internal Web App

You can register as many items as you want, with as many fields as you need! Once items are registered, you can click the "Check Out" option to mark them as in use, and when you're done using them, just return them to update the stock count.

This app is for internal use only due to security issues. It's just a quick project to help a few people. It will work properly, but because of the library versions and the image-sending method, the code is not secure to be exposed online. Maybe Iâ€™ll fix it in the future ðŸ˜Ž
